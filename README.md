# Ray Tracer

This is a ray tracer program in C. It takes, as input, a scene file and outputs an image. This is a project I made in grad school.

The biggest optimization I made is adding multicore support (which is honestly fairly easy to do in C).

To use, simply **make** the project and then run it from terminal:

```
./raytrace test.scn
```

The Scene File specification is in the supplied pdf.
